## Enjoy the unique Aucari travelling experience centred on some of the most amazing natural wonders of Chile and the world, while featuring perfect breaks and changes of pace with top tier hotels, restaurants, multi-sports spots and local culture.

Our goal is to convey the pleasures of vacations with the enthusiasm to learn; to become stronger by acquiring new outdoor skills, and getting in touch with nature by implementing mindful sustainability techniques, creating a window to the mind and a bridge between your soul and the stars.

With Aucari, you'll fly, drive, sail, trek and ride around magical corners of Chile, with the always present assistance from expert guides. Once you book a tour with us, get your international flight tickets to Chile and prepare your backpack at home --also with our remote assistance-- there's nothing else you need to worry about. For us, that is the true magic of All-Inclusive tours, making the experience as easy and straightforward as possible, so you can focus on what matters: enjoying, learning and living the present.

We also recognise that there are different types of travellers. While some are actively detail-oriented and love to plan every single step, others prefer the lightness of spontaneity. So once you book a tour with us, you'll be able to choose between 2 preparation manuals; one without new information, ideal for those who want to be surprised at every step, and another one with carefully detailed specifics of our itinerary.

**Weather & Climate**

From extreme temperatures in the desert to cloudy, rainy and foggy forests and freezing glaciers, you'll have to be ready to be exposed to all kind of elements in Aucari trips. If you're travelling with us, you should expect weather in all forms and colours. But don't worry, if you have any doubts related to this and want to prepare every single detail related to your personal equipment, our team will be happy to guide you remotely through Skype meetings.

**Physical Demands**

Aucari tours are meant to take you to what we consider the most beautiful places of nature, and while this can sound demanding, it doesn't need to be. While we suggest particular preparation to make the most out of trekking and other sports activities, our tours will be adjusted to your needs and rhythms, so the only thing that matters here is to keep an open heart for adventure.

**What you need to bring**

We need you to be ready for all seasons and elements, and also to practice some wilderness skills we will teach you along the way. That is why we will make sure you bring the necessary equipment by giving you detailed lists of gear previous your tour. Some basics are trekking boots, extra shoes, waterproof jacket, shorts, sun protection items, personal water bottles, etc.

## Itinerary Modifications

We reserve the right to change the order of the itinerary at the sole discretion of the trip guide and based on operational considerations. The tour guide can also modify, change or eliminate part of the planned activities based on safety/weather conditions.

# Learn  

## Sustainability

We approach the education of sustainable camping and travel as one of our primary goals. Not only because we must, but also because we see how it builds a unique appreciation towards natural life. It's about creating a new relationship towards our world.

## Wilderness skills

We also want to make this experience as rich as possible by showing you new tools and techniques for survival, camping, orientation and more. We believe these talents will help you strengthen you capacities and confidence, giving you more freedom and possibility. That's what we call robust knowledge.
