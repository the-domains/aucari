Vision

We believe in nature as a core element of our lives, and in creating a life that moves around it, inspired by it. Our purpose is to build meaningful, life-changing experiences that will permanently shape people's relationships towards nature and planet Earth, in a way that prompts self-discovery and awareness of a love and a transcendence found in the outdoors that overcomes what words can portrait.

Values

I. Protection

The strongest way we know to express our love and admiration to nature. But also, we believe this is the very first step for leadership; enabling to create groups based on mutual support and a real sense of belonging.

II. Curiosity

We believe in constant learning. No matter how skilled or successful we could be, we will never stop listening, observing and exploring. We see libraries and teachers the same way we see mountains and landscapes; places and concepts too rich and complex to ever stop being surprised with. There is always something that can challenge us, help us grow and become more.

III. Reconsideration

We question everything to acquire a proper understanding of our surroundings and overcome dogmas, which is key to achieving a difference that matters. Nature and the Universe exist in everlasting change; we accept and embrace this by trying stay flexible and prepared for novelty. This is the best way we know to stay vigorous and ready to find solutions when needed.

IV. We share our secret ingredients.

We show our knowledge, our techniques, points of view, and everything we believe makes us special. This is one of our most important, yet simple ways we know to build honest, lasting relationships other businesses made under sacred secrecy can't even dream of.

V. Dream together

Whether it is Aucari related or not, our mission is also to help the people around us reach the goals they seek. We love to encourage our team and friends to discover new ideas and find the support needed to achieve their dreams.

VI. Genuine

While we can observe, admire and eagerly learn from other's greatness, we won't sacrifice our uniqueness for anything. We sincerely value our personalities and identity, and our particular mix of strengths and weaknesses that make us unique.

VII. Creativity

We love to connect two or three things most would never put together. We constantly seek the challenge to go further with new ideas, in a way to engage a feeling; in a way that touches other's hearts.
